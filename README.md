# Cellar-Project-2

Cellar is an app designed to organize wine collections. The app sorts wine by color ("reds", "whites" and "others") and provides a table view of each wine in the collection with the year, producer, varitetal and number of bottles in the inventory. Each wine can also be displayed individually. The unique wine pages offer more information, including region, a url to the winemaker (if available), and the option to add additional notes and pairing options. There is also an option to add a photo of the wine, which could potentially make it easier to find. Details of each wine can be edited and the wine can be removed from the database. 

## Motivation
My motivation for creating this app was to actually organize our own wine collection and have the ability to access all of our wines from anywhere. This should save me any more yelling from the basement about possible pairings for dinner.
